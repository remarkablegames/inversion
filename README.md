# Inversion

<kbd>Inversion</kbd> is a 2D platformer puzzle game where you control two players that have to come together in order to win.

The game was made during the [Global Game Jame 2022](https://globalgamejam.org/2022/games/inversion-7) in which the theme was `duality`.

The game was bootstapped from the [`phaser-platformer`](https://github.com/remarkablegames/phaser-platformer) template.
